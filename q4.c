/**
A and B are very good friends. A works in company named C and B works in company
named D.Due to their work they are not able to meet each other frequently.
So they  decided to meet one day in  a restaurant. As they are very busy one
would not wait for another too long.  A will spend at most t1 seconds waiting
for B while B will wait no more than t2 seconds.

A can arrive at any moment within [0..T1] with equal probability. Similarly B
can arrive at any moment within [0..T2].

Arrival time may be any real number from the interval.

A asks you to calculate the probability of meeting his friend B in the restaurant.
