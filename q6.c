/**
SVNIT has just announced their Annual Techno-Cultural Fest SPARSH 2K17. But the
problem is you cannot take part in all the events as you lack the money.
Unfortunately, this is not the first time to happen.
You make up your mind to solve the problem where it arises, namely at the events
themselves. You introduce a limit for your event budget and try to have the most
possible fun with regard to this limit.
You inquire beforehand about the entrance fee to each event and estimate how
much fun you might have there. The list is readily compiled, but how do you actually
pick the events that give you the most fun and do not exceed your budget?
Write a program which finds this optimal set of events that offer the most fun.
Keep in mind that your budget need not necessarily be reached exactly. Achieve
the highest possible fun level, and do not spend more money than is absolutely necessary.
