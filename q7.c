/**
Since the dawn of mankind, humanity was at peace until the arrival of Kali Yuga.
Greed and hatred has taken over humanity. To end this, a mystical sect of saints
chose a man to rise up against all odds and defeat the evil prevailing within society.
When the five natural elements of life, fire, earth, water, wind and sky invigorated
his body, he gains superpowers and becomes a Shaktiman (Superhuman).

His signature attack is cloning himself. Every element can further be divided into
more elements. Each element is a 'clone' to other.
Shaltiman arrives alone at the battlefield at t=1 second. At each time step ,
t= 1,2,3,….,n second , some of the Shaktimans will leave to start fighting the
enemy and the rest will stay back and perform the cloning again. If a clone has
left to fight the enemy he cannot come back to perform the attack. Also at t=n
seconds all Shaktimans will go to fight with the enemy, i. e. no more cloning
will take place on and after n seconds. Shaktiman is a very dedicated man so he
won’t allow any of his clone to stay out of the fight. The saint observes Shaktiman's actions.
He notes down the number of clones that went to fight the enemy at each time step
( from t=1 second till t=n second). However he is old and doubts if his observations
 are correct. He hires you, a prodigy of the 90's with sharp analytical skills, to
 check if his observations can be valid or not.
